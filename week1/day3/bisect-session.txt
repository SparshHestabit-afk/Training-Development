Git bisect was used to identify the commit that introduced a bug in the repository history.


The bisect process was started by marking the current commit as bad (where incorrect behavior was observed) and an earlier commit as good (where the code was known to work correctly).
  



Git then automatically checked intermediate commits and narrowed down the faulty change.


  



  

After a few steps, git bisect identified Commit 4 as the first bad commit where the incorrect change was introduced.


  



  

Once the faulty commit was identified, the bisect session was properly reset to restore the repository to its original state.
